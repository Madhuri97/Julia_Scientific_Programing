Modelling
SIR Model: Susceptable,Infected and Removed
* SIR model concepts, equations for infectious diseases
S = S(0), which is number of suspectables at the start of epidemic is a key value in model
I = the number of infected people at a time t is given by I(t) we assume I(0) > 0 becoz the epidemic cant start
R = people previously infected but no longer infectious are called "removed" R(t) to symbolise the number of removed people at time t
whole number
law of mass action
number of infected and suspected is proportional to SI
the time is ti where i is steps ti = idt
S(ti), I(ti) and R(ti) to predict S(ti+1), R(ti+1) and R(ti+1)
* Function for one-time-step
by including SIR as one function and update at a time
* The loop structure
* Running model
* Plotting results --> based on time dependent

Thresold prdiction:
Rcall the eaquations

Plotting Data and an Approximately fitted line simultaneously:
plot!() --> plot bang(used to overlay a fitted curve to a scatter of data)this will change the plot with slight changes in values without specifying. everytime it changes it will be more efficient than previous vs plot()
Modify the plot adding labels, axis styles, line styles(fill!)

fitting the model parameters
using above all methods we do for EVD data

fitting circle to data
* Make a parametric plot of a circle with given radius and position
* Superimpose a circle with arbitrary radius and position on a given data set
* Adjust your plotted circle by hand
